In this post, i will share about how to fix student data generation of Open edX **Not Found.** This problem occurs when we donâ€™t use **s3** as to save student data generation.

To fix this problem we have to create a link to true location ofÂ **.csv** file (**/tmp/edx-s3/grades**) in **/edx/var/edxapp/media** directory by typing the following command.
```bash
$ ln -s /tmp/edx-s3/grades /edx/var/edxapp/media
```
Then, update nginx VirtualHost configuration of lms (**/edx/app/nginx/sites-avaliable/lms**). Find the following codes on the file:
```bash
location ~ ^/media/(?P<file>.\*) {  
    root /edx/var/edxapp/media;  
    try\_files /$file =404;  
    expires 31536000s;  
}
```

then update it with the following codes:

```bash
location ~ ^/media/(?P<file>.\*) {  
    root /edx/var/edxapp/media;  
    try\_files /$file /grades/$file;  
    expires 31536000s;  
}

location ~ ^/grades/(?P<file>.\*) {  
    root /edx/var/edxapp/media/grades;  
    try\_files /$file =404;  
    expires 31536000s;  
}
```

Restart the nginx service

```bash
$ sudo service nginx restart
```
